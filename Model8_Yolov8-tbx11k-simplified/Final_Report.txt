On a sample of totally unseen, test images the model performed as followos :: 


Mean IoU = 58.47 %
Recall = 70.5 %
RMSE = 18.3


IoU -> Are of Intersection over Union refers to the [(Intersection area of predicted and true bounding box) / (Union area of predicted and true bounding box)]

Recall -> Percentage of the true bounding box covered by the predicted bounding box. It has only been calculated for images with an IoU >= 0.5.

RMSE -> Gives the root of the mean of our predicted coordinated of Xmin and Ymin.
